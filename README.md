# mushcode README

This tool is a combination of a mush stynax highlighter and a mushcode formatter.

## Basic formatting

The formatter is available as a context menu item.  Just select the code you want to format, right click, and select "Format mushcode".  That's it.

## Send to RHOST

If you're running a RhostMUSH [1] you can actually send your code right to your api object to install directly to server!

First, update your settings to include your RhostMUSH API key and the name of your api object.  Then, select the code you want to send, right click, and select "Send to RHOST".  The code will be sent to your api object and installed on your server.

You can also se the keyboard shortcut `ctrl-shift-f` to send the code to RHOST.
